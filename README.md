# Symmetric Cryptography: DES & AES Encryption-Decryption Tool 🛡️

## Introduction 📖

This project, developed for our Introduction to Information Security course, showcases a web-based tool that facilitates encryption and decryption using two seminal symmetric cryptography algorithms: DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). This application provides an interactive and intuitive interface, enabling users to engage with the core principles of these encryption methods.
